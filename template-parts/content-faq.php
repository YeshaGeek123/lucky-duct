                                            A lot of people don't realize that their furnaces, air conditioner, and other heating and cooling systems are equipped with HEPA filters. These air filters are designed to remove particles from the air you breathe.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The process your furnace or air conditioner uses to clean the air is called filtration. Because it's so important for your health, these filters need to be cleaned periodically. Keeping them clean will help keep you safe from airborne allergens like dust mites and pollen.
                                        </p>

                                            Dust particles are tiny pieces of dirt that float in the air. They can spread disease and cause allergic reactions in some people. But HEPA filters will capture dust particles down to 0.3 microns in size — 3 times smaller than what even a medical microscope can see!
